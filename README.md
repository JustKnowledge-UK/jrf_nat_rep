The focus of this project is to co-develop a piece of research on the low-paid outsourced workforce in the UK, with a particular focus on the experiences of Black workers.

The quantitative aspect of this work involves three surveys:

A short ‘test’ survey of 2,000 respondents, the aim of which is to help refine questions on outsourcing
A short survey of 10,000 workers, the aim of which is to estimate the number of outsourced workers and the demographics of the outsourced workforce
A longer survey of 2,000 outsourced workers, the aim of which is to understand more about their experiences of work

This project is an analysis of survey #2 conducted on 10000 respondents in December 2023.
