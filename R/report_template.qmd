    n = n()
  ) %>%

# Create function to find nearest denominator to express as a fraction.
f <- function(x) ifelse(abs(1/floor(1/x) - x) < abs(1/ceiling(1/x) - x),floor(1/x),ceiling(1/x))
```

### According to our definition, 1 in `r f(total_outsourced$Proportion[which(total_outsourced$outsourcing_status=="Outsourced")])` UK workers are outsourced.

Based on this definition, we've found that just under `r round(total_outsourced$Percentage[which(total_outsourced$outsourcing_status=="Outsourced")], 0)`% of UK workers are 'outsourced'[^1]. Who makes up this group of 17% of UK workers?

The results here indicate that among workers that are not paid below our low pay threshold, an outsourced worker can typically be expected to earn considerably more than a non-outsourced worker, whereas among workers that are paid below our low pay threshold, an outsourced worker can typically be expected to be paid the same as a non-outsourced worker (maybe slightly less).

### Major group code

Comparison of Majorgroupcode indicates that a higher proportion of outsourced people work in Elementary Occupations, compared to non-outsourced people. A lower proportion of outsourced people work in administrative and secretarial occupations, associate professional occupations and professional occupations.

```{r MGC}
mgc_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(outsourcing_status,Majorgroupcode) %>%
  summarise(
    Frequency = sum(NatRepemployees),
    avg_income = mean(income_annual, na.rm=T),
    wtd_avg_income = weighted.mean(income_annual, w = NatRepemployees, na.rm=T)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    Sum = sum(Frequency),
    perc = 100 * (Frequency/Sum)
  )

readr::write_csv(mgc_summary, "../outputs/data/majorgroupcode_summary.csv")
```

```{r MGC-plot}
mgc_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(outsourcing_status, perc, fill = as.factor(Majorgroupcode))) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=many_colours)

mgc_key <- data.frame("number" = seq(1,11,1),
                            "Major group code" = c( levels(haven::as_factor(mgc_summary$Majorgroupcode)),NA))

mgc_key %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

The table below shows the percentage of outsourced and non-outsourced workers in each majorgroupcode, as well as the difference between them (positive numbers in the difference column indicate occupations that are more common for outsourced work, negative numbers indicate occupations that are less common for outsourced work).[^3]

[^3]: Datafile: "../outputs/data/majorgroupcode_summary.csv"

```

The plot below summarises the average pay (x-axis) in each occupation (y-axis) for outsourced and non-outsourced workers (dot colour), as well as the size of the respective workforce (size of dots). Here the size of the dot represents the percentage of workers *within* the sector who are outsourced (blue) or not outsourced (purple).[^4]

[^4]: Data file: "../outputs/data/majorgroupcode_summary_long.csv" & "../outputs/data/majorgroupcode_summary_wide.csv")

```{r MGC-bubble}
mgc_summary_2 %>%
  mutate(
    Majorgroupcode = haven::as_factor(Majorgroupcode)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(Majorgroupcode, wtd_avg_income, size = perc, colour = outsourcing_status)) +
    geom_point(position = "dodge") + 
    coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank())+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,max(mgc_summary$wtd_avg_income), 25000)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=colours) +
  guides(size=FALSE) # remove size legend as gauging size is difficult

```

It shows, as might be expected, the size of the outsourced workforce for each sector is smaller than the non-outsourced workforce, but the ratio is not the same for all sectors. The sector with the largest non-outsourced:outsourced ratio is Elementary occupations; **for every 10 non-outsourced workers, there are `r round(mgc_summary_2_wider$Ratio_10[which(mgc_summary_2_wider$Majorgroupcode == "ELEMENTARY OCCUPATIONS")],0)` outsourced workers**. This is followed by caring, leisure, and other service occupations, and process, plant and machine operatives, both of which employ **`r round(mgc_summary_2_wider$Ratio_10[which(mgc_summary_2_wider$Majorgroupcode == "PROCESS, PLANT AND MACHINE OPERATIVES")],0)` outsourced workers for every 10 non-outsourced workers**.

Notably, in elementary occupations and sales and customer service occupations, outsourced workers are on average paid more than non-outsourced workers. In contrast, workers in process, plant and machine operations are paid less if they are outsourced than if they are not outsourced.

#### Unit occupations

A deep dive into elementary occupations, process occupations, and caring occupations reveals that there are differences between occupations in the size of the outsourced workforce and pay.

The plot below shows the sector breakdown by outsourcing status. I.e. this is how outsourced and not outsourced workers are distributed across sectors.

::: callout-note
With this framing we could say things like "as an outsourced worker, you are x times more likely to work in <sector> than a non-outsourced worker"
:::

```{r sector-plot}
plot_data <- sector_summary %>%
  drop_na(SectorName_labelled) %>%
  droplevels()

plot_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(outsourcing_status, perc, fill = as.factor(SectorName))) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=many_colours)

sector_key <- data.frame("number" = seq(1,length(unique(plot_data$SectorName)),1),
                            "Sector" = levels(plot_data$SectorName_labelled))

sector_key %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

The table below shows what percentage of outsourced and non-outsourced workers work in each sector, as well as the difference between them (positive numbers in the difference column indicate sectors that are more common for outsourced work, negative numbers indicate sectors that are less common for outsourced work).\[\^Datafile: "../outputs/data/sector_summary.csv"\]

It indicates that sectors that are *less common* for outsourced workers compared to not outsourced are:

-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==19])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==8])`

And sectors that are *more common* for outsourced workers compared to not outsourced are:

-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==4])`

For these sectors that differ most in the concentration of the outsourced workforce, there is a pattern (if three data points can be called that) whereby in sectors with a relatively higher concentration of outsourced workers, outsourced workers are paid less, and in sectors with a relatively lower concentration of outsourced workers, outsourced workers are paid more. This is tenuous, but it is an example of the heterogeneity in income between sectors, and should be explored further.

```{r sector-table}
sector_summary_3 <- plot_data %>%
  select(outsourcing_status, SectorName, SectorName_short, perc, wtd_avg_income) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = outsourcing_status, values_from = c(perc, wtd_avg_income)) %>%
  mutate(
    perc_difference = `perc_Outsourced` - `perc_Not outsourced`,
    income_difference = `wtd_avg_income_Outsourced` - `wtd_avg_income_Not outsourced`
    ) %>%
  relocate(
    perc_difference, .after = perc_Outsourced
  )

sector_summary_3 %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(perc_difference))) %>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

The plot below plots the percentage difference in the concentration of outsourced vs non-outsourced workers (i.e. the difference between what proportion of workers of each type are in each sector) against the income difference for that sector (i.e., the difference in the average income between groups). Note that a statistical test of this relationship shows it is non-significant. This plot therefore only serves as an illustration of where workers are situated in terms of sector and pay. A key takeaway here is that there is considerable variation in the difference in pay between outsourced and non-outsourced workers. There also appears to be a central area where the concentration of outsourced vs non-outsourced workers is quite similar, but the pay for outsourced workers is lower. This might indicate sectors where employment of outsourced workers is as common as employment of non-outsourced workers, but where outsourced workers are paid less than non-outsourced workers. These sectors are:

-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName[plot_data$SectorName==5])`: `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==5])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName[plot_data$SectorName==6])`: `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==6])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName[plot_data$SectorName==9])`: `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==9])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName[plot_data$SectorName==20])`: `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==20])`

#### Outsourcing status within sector

This framing shows how sectors are composed, i.e., what proportion of workers in each sector are outsourced vs non-outsourced.

```{r sector-summary-2}
sector_summary_2 <- data %>%
  group_by(SectorName, SectorName_labelled, outsourcing_status) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Frequency = sum(NatRepemployees),
    avg_income = mean(income_annual, na.rm=T),
    wtd_avg_income = weighted.mean(income_annual, w = NatRepemployees, na.rm=T)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(SectorName) %>%
  mutate(
    N = sum(n),
    Sum = sum(Frequency),
    perc = 100 * (Frequency/Sum),
    SectorName_labelled = case_when(SectorName_labelled == "NA" ~ NA,
                                    TRUE ~ SectorName_labelled),
    SectorName_short = SectorName_labelled
  ) %>%
  # make the sector names more readable
  separate_wider_delim(SectorName_short, names = c("SectorName_short", "SectorName_short_detail"), delim=";",
                       too_few = "align_start") %>%
  mutate(
    SectorName_short = factor(stringr::str_to_sentence(SectorName_short)),
    SectorName_short_detail = factor(stringr::str_to_sentence(SectorName_short_detail)),
  )
```

The plot below shows the proportion of outsourced and not outsourced workers within each sector. I.e. this is showing what sectors have higher and lower proportions of outsourced workers.

::: callout-note
With this framing we could say things like "sector a is x times more likely to employ outsourced workers than sector b"
:::

```{r sector-plot-2}
plot_data <- sector_summary_2 %>%
  drop_na(SectorName_short) %>%
  droplevels()

# annotation_df <- plot_data %>%
#   select(SectorName_short, outsourcing_status, perc, n
# mutate(
  
annotation_df <- plot_data %>%
  filter(outsourcing_status == "Not outsourced") %>%
  select(SectorName_short, N) %>%

    ypos = 80
  )

# sector_key <- data.frame("number" = seq(1,length(unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled)),1),
#                           "Sector" = levels(plot_data$SectorName_labelled))
# 
# sector_key %>%
#   kable() %>%
#   kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

The table below shows the percentage of outsourced workers in each Sector, ordered descending by percentage. It shows that the top three Sectors with the highest proportion of outsourced workers are:

-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==3])` (note that N = 31)
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==4])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==22])`

Note that for an undefined sector ('Not found') contained one of the largest proportions of outsourced workers (`r round(plot_data$perc[which(plot_data$SectorName==16 & plot_data$outsourcing_status=="Outsourced")],0)`% of workers in the 'Not found' category were outsourced).

```{r}
plot_data %>%
  filter(outsourcing_status == "Outsourced") %>%
  arrange(desc(perc)) %>%
  select(SectorName_labelled, perc) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Exploring this workforce makeup in the context of income shows that there are some sectors where outsourced workers are paid more and some where they are paid less than non-outsourced workers. The plot below visualises this.

Sectors where outsourced workers are paid less:

-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==3])` (note that N = 31)
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==4])` (note that N = 32)
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==5])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==6])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==9])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==19])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==20])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==22])`

Sectors where outsourced workers are paid more:

-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==1])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==7])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==8])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==12])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==13])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==16])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==17])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==18])`
-   `r unique(plot_data$SectorName_labelled[plot_data$SectorName==20])`

Note that in 2 or 3 of the Sectors where outsourced workers are paid less are low-paying Sectors. (this needs to be double-checked)

annotation_df <- sector_summary_2 %>%
  filter(outsourcing_status == "Not outsourced") %>%

    Percentage = 100 * (Frequency / Sum)
  )

readr::write_csv(ethnicity_statistics, file = "../outputs/data/ethnicity_stats_1.csv")

non_white_ethnicities <- ethnicities[!(ethnicities %in% "English / Welsh / Scottish / Northern Irish / British")]


# Will throw NA warning. I think this OK but investigate how to avoid the problem
summary_table <- data %>%
  mutate(
    Ethnicity = haven::as_factor(Ethnicity)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Ethnicity = forcats::fct_collapse(as.character(Ethnicity),
                                      "White British" = c("English / Welsh / Scottish / Northern Irish / British"),
                                      "Non-White British" = non_white_ethnicities)

  )

group_1 <- t(tibble("present"=summary_table[which(summary_table["Ethnicity"]=="White British" & 
                                 summary_table["outsourcing_status"]=="Outsourced"),"n"],
"not present" = summary_table[which(summary_table["Ethnicity"]=="Non-White British" & 
                                 summary_table["outsourcing_status"]=="Outsourced"),"n"]
))

group_2 <- t(tibble("present"=summary_table[which(summary_table["Ethnicity"]=="White British" & 
                                 summary_table["outsourcing_status"]=="Not outsourced"),"n"],

comp_mat <- as.matrix(cbind(group_2, group_1)) # matrix for crosstable
x2 <- gmodels::CrossTable(comp_mat, fisher=TRUE)
# `r if(x2[["chisq"]][["p.value"]] < .001, "< .001", paste0("= ", round(x2[["chisq"]][["p.value"]],2)))`).
# (chi-square = `r round(x2[["chisq"]][["statistic"]][["X-squared"]],2)`, *p* = `r round(x2[["chisq"]][["p.value"]],3)`).
```

Breaking down by ethnicity shows that the outsourced group has a lower proportion of White workers compared to the non-outsourced group. For example, in the outsourced group, the proportion of British ('White') workers is `r round(ethnicity_statistics[which(ethnicity_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Outsourced" & ethnicity_statistics$Ethnicity == "English / Welsh / Scottish / Northern Irish / British"), "Percentage"],2)` %, compared to `r round(ethnicity_statistics[which(ethnicity_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Not outsourced" & ethnicity_statistics$Ethnicity == "English / Welsh / Scottish / Northern Irish / British"), "Percentage"],2)`% in the not outsourced group. Needless to say, this means that there is a correspondingly higher proportion of workers from minority backgrounds in the outsourced group, notably from African (`r round(ethnicity_statistics[which(ethnicity_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Outsourced" & ethnicity_statistics$Ethnicity == "African"), "Percentage"],2)`%) and other White backgrounds (`r round(ethnicity_statistics[which(ethnicity_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Outsourced" & ethnicity_statistics$Ethnicity == "Any other White background"), "Percentage"],2)`, amongst others.[^8] These differences mean that **outsourced workers are `r round(x2[["fisher.ts"]][["estimate"]][["odds ratio"]],2)` times more likely to be a member of minority ethnicity than non-outsourced workers.**

<!---# We should construct a full model predicting outsourcing status from demographics --->

Another way of looking at this is to calculate, for each ethnicity, the proportion of workers in each outsourcing group. Doing so yields the plot below.[^9]

                                      "Not born in UK" = non_categories)

                                 summary_table["outsourcing_status"]=="Outsourced"),"n"],
"not present" = summary_table[which(summary_table[domain]==category_2 &

comp_mat <- as.matrix(cbind(group_2, group_1)) # matrix for crosstable

```

A greater proportion of outsourced workers were not born in the UK (`r 100 - round(bornuk_statistics[which(bornuk_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Outsourced" & bornuk_statistics$BORNUK == "I was born in the UK"), "Percentage"],2)`%) compared to non-outsourced workers (`r 100 - round(bornuk_statistics[which(bornuk_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Not outsourced" & bornuk_statistics$BORNUK == "I was born in the UK"), "Percentage"],2)`%).[^10] This difference is statistically significant; **outsourced workers are `r round(x2[["fisher.ts"]][["estimate"]][["odds ratio"]],2)` times more likely to have been born outside the UK than non-outsourced workers.**

[^10]: Data file: outputs/data/arrival_in_UK_stats.csv

Looking at the figure below, it appears that no particular arrival time is especially common amongst the outsourced group, with a relatively equal distribution across arrival times (though potentially a slightly larger proportion fall into the 'Within the last 10 years category'). The is broadly the case for the likely agency and high indicators groups too, though note that amongst likely agency there is a slightly larger proportion of workers who have arrived within the last year.

In terms of Gender, the outsourced group has a larger proportion of males (`r round(gender_statistics[which(gender_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Outsourced" & gender_statistics$Gender == "Male"),"Percentage"], 2)`% compared to `r round(gender_statistics[which(gender_statistics$outsourcing_status == "Not outsourced" & gender_statistics$Gender == "Male"),"Percentage"], 2)`%). This difference is statistically significant; **outsourced workers are `r round(x2[["fisher.ts"]][["estimate"]][["odds ratio"]],2)` times more likely to have be male than non-outsourced workers.**

### Region[^13]

[^13]: Data file: outputs/data/region_statistics.csv

The plot below suggests that an outsourced worker is more likely to be based in London than a non-outsourced worker.

```{r}
region_statistics <- data %>%
  # get values of labels
  # mutate_all(haven::as_factor) %>%
  group_by(outsourcing_status, Region) %>%
  summarise(
    Frequency = sum(NatRepemployees)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Sum = sum(Frequency),
    Percentage = 100 * (Frequency / Sum)
  ) %>%
  rename(
    `Outsourcing group` = outsourcing_status
  )

region_statistics %>%
  mutate(
    Region = haven::as_factor(Region)
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable(.,digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)

region_statistics %>%
  mutate(
    Region = haven::as_factor(Region)
    ) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(`Outsourcing group`, Percentage, fill = Region)) +
  geom_col(colour="black") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=many_colours) +
  theme_minimal()

readr::write_csv(region_statistics, file="../outputs/data/region_statistics.csv")

```

In the plot below the percentages have been scaled to the size of the working population in the region as a function of the total working population in the UK. I need to check whether this scaling is actually necessary, given we are already using weighted data.[^14] Does the weighting process account for region?

    # make age numeric, not a labelled factor
    Age = as.numeric(as.character(Age))
  ) %>%
  group_by(outsourcing_status) %>%

  summarise(
    mean = mean(Age, na.rm = T),
    median = median(Age,na.rm = T),
    min = min(Age,na.rm = T),
    max = max(Age,na.rm = T),
    stdev = sd(Age,na.rm = T)
  )

readr::write_csv(age_statistics, file = "../outputs/data/age_stats.csv")
```

```{r age-inferential,include=FALSE}
# note that this test calculates different means to the one above. why??
# it's to do with haven factors...
# using data_labelled and and combination of as.numeric(as.character()) solves it

ttest <- t.test(data[which(data$outsourcing_status=="Outsourced"),"Age"], 
       data[which(data$outsourcing_status=="Not outsourced"),"Age"]
)

```

```{r}
# test <- data %>%
#   subset(outsourcing_status=="Outsourced") %>%
#   summarise(
#     mean_age = mean(Age)
#   )
# 
# test_1_5 <-  data %>%
#   subset(outsourcing_status=="Outsourced") %>%
#   summarise(
#     mean_age = mean(Age, na.rm=T)
#   )
# 
# test_2 <- data %>%
#   subset(outsourcing_status=="Not outsourced") %>%
#   summarise(
#     mean_age = mean(Age)
#   )
# 
# test_2_5 <- data %>%
#   subset(outsourcing_status=="Not outsourced") %>%

#   mutate(
#     age_mean = mean(Age),
#     haven_age_mean = mean(as.numeric(as.character(haven_age)), na.rm=T)
#   )
```

As shown in the table below, the median age of the outsourced group is `r age_statistics[which(age_statistics$outsourcing_status=="Outsourced"),"median"]` , compared to `r age_statistics[which(age_statistics$outsourcing_status=="Not outsourced"),"median"]` for the not outsourced group.[^15]

[^15]: Data file: outputs/data/age_stats.csv

However, as the next figure shows, the age distribution is different for the outsourced and high indicator groups compared to the not outsourced and likely agency groups; the outsourced and high indicator groups have higher proportions of younger people (\~21-36 year olds).

A t-test indicates that on average, **outsourced workers are significantly younger than non-outsourced workers** (*t*(`r round(ttest[["parameter"]][["df"]],2)`) = `r round(ttest[["statistic"]][["t"]],2)`, *p* = `r round(ttest[["p.value"]],2)`).

```{r age}
